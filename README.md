# Pong(?)

I don't think this is pong... **IT'S SO MUCH MORE!**

## The Most Overcomplicated Pong Game Ever Created

Welcome to **Quantum Chaos Pong**, a game that takes the classic Pong concept and launches it into the quantum multiverse with advanced physics, neural network AI, and pure chaos!

### üéÆ Features

- **Quantum Physics Simulation** - Real quantum mechanics including:
  - Wave function collapse and superposition
  - Quantum entanglement
  - Heisenberg uncertainty principle
  - Quantum tunneling through barriers
  - Dimensional rifts (portals)
  - Everywhere and nowhere
- **Neural Network AI** - TensorFlow.js powered AI that learns from your gameplay
- **Advanced Physics** - Gravity, friction, elasticity, momentum, angular velocity, force fields
- **Particle System** - Up to 5,000 particles for stunning visual effects. RTX 5090 required (Kidding. Mostly)
- **Procedural Audio** - Dynamic music generation using Web Audio API
- **12 Power-Up Types** - Speed boost, multi-ball, shields, time manipulation, and more
- **Multiple Game Modes** - VS AI, VS Quantum AI, and CHAOS MODE. All self-explanatory.
- **Obstacles** - Moving, rotating, and breakable obstacles add complexity
- **Visual Effects** - Screen shake, glows, trails, quantum entanglement lines

### üïπÔ∏è How to Play

1. Open `index.html` in a modern web browser

### üéØ Game Modes Explained

**VS AI (Neural Network)**
- AI uses deep Q-learning to adapt to your playstyle
- Learns from every match
- Saves trained model to browser storage

The AI model is not heavy. It is trained to play Pong, not be GPT-oss:120b.

**VS Quantum AI**
- Uses quantum superposition for predictions
- Embraces the uncertainty principle
- Unpredictable and challenging

**CHAOS MODE**
- Multiple obstacles spawn in the field
- Rotating barriers and breakable blocks
- Force fields (vortex, magnetic)
- Power-ups spawn continuously
- Increasing chaos level over time

### üåü Special Mechanics

**Quantum Superposition** (SPACE)
- Ball exists in multiple states simultaneously
- Creates ghost balls at different positions
- Collapses to a random state when observed

**Dimensional Rifts** (Q)
- Create wormholes for instant teleportation
- Ball can travel through rifts
- Limited stability duration

**Time Manipulation** (E)
- Slow down game time to 50%
- Costs quantum energy
- Strategic advantage for difficult shots

### üìä Stats Tracked

**Warning:** This game may cause:
- Temporal paradoxes
- Quantum entanglement with your screen
- Addiction to overcomplicated game mechanics
- A newfound appreciation for simple Pong

(You won't) Enjoy the chaos! 

I considered using the Gemini API, but the response time was too low and I needed requests to send instantly. I probably should've said "Up or down?" and if the AI said up then it would trigger a 
virtual keypress. And I know, hardcoded API keys = bad, but I give out like 20 a month. Google never bills me.

Google please fix I will bankrupt you if no
