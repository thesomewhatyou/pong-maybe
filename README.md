I don't think this is pong.

## ðŸŒŒ What is this madness?

This is not your grandma's pong. This is an extremely overcomplicated game of pong featuring:

### ðŸ”¬ Quantum Physics
- **Quantum Superposition**: The ball exists in multiple states simultaneously (ghost balls everywhere!)
- **Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle**: The more you know about the ball's position, the less you know about its velocity
- **Quantum Tunneling**: Ball might phase through paddles because... quantum mechanics!
- **Wave Function Collapse**: Each collision reduces uncertainty (temporarily)
- **Quantum Entanglement**: Reality itself might flip and invert everything

### ðŸ§  Neural Network AI
- The AI opponent uses a simple neural network that learns from gameplay
- It adapts to your playing style over time
- Reinforcement learning adjusts weights based on wins/losses
- Quantum randomness affects AI decisions because why not?

### ðŸŽª Maximum Wackiness
- **Reality Degradation**: The fabric of spacetime decays during intense quantum events
- **Glitch Mode**: Break physics and watch reality fragment
- **Quantum Events**: Random chaotic effects trigger during gameplay
- **Particle Effects**: SchrÃ¶dinger would be proud (or confused)
- **Visual Glitches**: Reality glitches appear when things get too quantum

## ðŸŽ® How to Play

1. Open `index.html` in your web browser
2. Press **START** to begin
3. Use **W/S** or **Arrow Up/Down** keys to control your paddle (green)
4. Try to score against the AI (magenta paddle)
5. Watch as quantum mechanics makes everything weird

### Controls
- **START**: Begin the chaos
- **PAUSE**: Pause the game
- **RESET REALITY**: Reset scores and restore reality
- **TOGGLE QUANTUM MODE**: Turn quantum effects on/off
- **BREAK PHYSICS**: Enable glitch mode for maximum chaos

## ðŸ¤¯ Features Explained

### Quantum Flux
A meter showing how much quantum weirdness is happening. Higher flux = more chaos.

### Reality Percentage
When reality drops below 100%, things get... weird. The universe becomes unstable.

### Uncertainty
The ball's uncertainty increases with collisions, making its behavior more unpredictable.

## ðŸŽ¯ Winning

There is no winning. Only quantum chaos. But there are scores if that makes you feel better.

## ðŸ’» Technical Details

Built with vanilla JavaScript and HTML5 Canvas. No frameworks, no dependencies, just pure quantum chaos.

- **Neural Network**: Simple perceptron-like network with weighted inputs
- **Quantum Effects**: Probability-based events and visual superposition
- **Particle System**: For extra visual flair
- **Reality Engine**: Tracks universe stability

Why not?
